# Profitable App Profiles Analysis for Apple Store and Google Play Platform

This project focuses on analyzing the available dataset found for Apple and Google Play Platform by using only concepts focusing on Basic to Intermediate Python Principles without using any libraries.

The project centers for a fictional company who would like to build on free-apps and having their source of revenue as " in-app purchase" 
The business problem for this project is to identify the types of apps which are most influenced by users targeting mainly English Speaking Audience (the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better) 

We start by analyzing our initial raw datasources to see patterns where we can improvise our data for clean-up. After the initial assessment the data cleaning process is followed in this approach.
  1. Remove Inaccurate values 
  2. Remove duplicate app entries ( Check Notebook for the approach )
  3. Removing Non- English Apps
  4. Isloating Free apps 
  
At the end of the data cleaning process, The reasons for data validation are provided to enable users to understand the data cleaning process.
We analzyse the most common app genres in both Google Play and Apple Store to find our targets to provide recommedation of apps based on data-driven approach
